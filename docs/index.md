# Introduction

**degirum-face** is a high-performance Python library for face detection, recognition, and tracking in images and video. Built for production deployments with minimal code and support for CPU and edge AI accelerators.

**Fast and efficient** face recognition with:
- Face detection, alignment, embedding extraction, and matching for images, video files, and live streams
- **Multi-hardware support**: CPU, GPU, and edge AI accelerators (Hailo, Axelera, DEEPX, Intel, NVIDIA, Rockchip, Google, DeGirum)
- **Simple APIs**: Minimal code to detect, enroll, and recognize faces with easy batch processing
- **Flexible configuration**: Python or YAML config for models, thresholds, and database paths
- **Production-ready tracking**: Real-time face re-identification, event notifications, and automated alert recording
- **Robust database**: LanceDB-based storage with vector similarity search
